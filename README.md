# University Web Scraper
## Description
Open ended project with an emphasis on usability. Utilizing the Beautiful Soup package, I worked in
python making requests to my universities computer science course page. I stored all the links redirecting
to the specific courses information page in a list. Used a technique to remove duplicates and wrote to a
file displaying the information in a concise manner. Others and myself presented information related to
the scraper such as run time, design approach and scraper traps. Used my personal website to convey a
visual representation of a degree tree path that can be integrated with my university's site for students to
have a better understanding of class order.
